<p><strong><em>26/05/14 to 1/06/14</em></strong></p>

<p>With <a href='https://twitter.com/jterrell' >J. Terrell Allen</a>'s suggestion I started using <a href='https://www.toggl.com/' >Toggl</a> to track my time and it clearly shows that I need to spend more time on the course than Meetups. Especially with a full-time job, I need to start managing my time in a better fashion.</p>

<p>When <a href='http://twitter.com/neeleshmittal' >Neelesh Mittal</a> asked the question, I had to do a bit of thinking as to how to answer him. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How to create clean &amp; great looking websites?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beautiful and Perfect are two words which rules my work a lot. So, when I create a website, it is second-nature for me to work on it until it has that clean &amp; beautiful look that I visualize in my mind. Before, I start talking about how you might be able to make your websites pretty, you should read the disclaimer above.</p>

<h2 id="getthebasicsright">Get the basics right</h2>

<p>This will be the first piece of advice every designer will give to people starting with design. You need to understand what is <a href='http://jeyakarthika.com/what-is-design' >design</a> and learn about the <a href='http://jeyakarthika.com/elements-and-principles-of-design' >elements and principles of design</a>.</p>

<h2 id="designtheinterfaceforyourusers">Design the interface for your users</h2>

<p>The websites you create are not for you! Every website is built for a target audience. You need to put on your thinking cap and enter the user's shoes. Think about every piece of the user interface you create and make design decisions which will make your website easy to use. Your design should focus heavily on providing the best experience for your user. Make it usable first, fun next.</p>

<p>"<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758' >Don't Make me Think</a>" by Steve Kruger is a very good place to start.</p>

<h2 id="getinspired">Get Inspired</h2>

<p>Do the following as often as possible, if not daily.</p>

<ol>
<li>Browse design galleries like Awwwards, dribble, behance &amp; find out what others are designing.  </li>
<li>Stop &amp; Analyze what you like and don't like about each.  </li>
<li>Start noticing design patterns.  </li>
<li>Note down patterns &amp; design trends you like.  </li>
<li>Use Pinterest to create a moodboards for inspiration.</li>
</ol>

<p>This way you will get familiar with how other people are designing and eventually be able to do get that line of thinking necessary to integrate design into the functionality of your website.</p>

<h2 id="stealresponsibly">Steal Responsibly</h2>

<p>As you find designs you love, start copying the style and practice them on personal projects. Once you start getting comfortable, make your own designs. There are a lot of quality design resources which you could use get up and running very fast.</p>

<h2 id="haveyourowndesignprocess">Have your own design process</h2>

<p>You need to understand that,  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Design is not a layer that you apply to your website.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The website's functionality should go hand in hand with its appearance and behavior. As you logically plan the functionality and code the site, you should think about how it should look. So, try to find a design process to integrate with your workflow.</p>

<p>It can be as simple as using pen and paper to sketch out mock-ups or it can be very detailed with a researching, moodboarding, sketching, photoshopping and prototyping. I would suggest keeping it simple and experiment until you find what works for you.</p>

<p>This is the important part. You are in the field which evolves every day. What was new yesterday has already been replaced by something new &amp; shiny today. So, it is very important to be in the know. How? Subscribe to magazines &amp; blogs and Follow design professionals.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, I have shared what I have learnt and practiced to get myself started with design. You might have noticed that I didn't mention the part about learning photoshop or illustrator. Only because, I think everyone knows that they need to have a basic know-how of photoshop &amp; illustrator to atleast use the free resources and save it in the web format they need.</p>

<p>Hello folks, My 3 months of cloning &amp; coding with ThinkFul's Front-End Web Development course has come to an end. I would say these 3 months have been the <strong><em>most-productive</em></strong> in my learning journey. I have learnt a lot and I have a lot to show for it. Yes, My portfolio is live as of 15th March, 2014 <a href='http://jeyakarthika.com/portfolio' >here</a>. </p>

<p>It has been a habit of mine to just sit back and reflect when ever I complete a big project. It kind of helps me to learn from my own experience. This way I am able to <strong><em>make new mistakes</em></strong> instead of the same old ones again. Sometimes it gives me insight into things like how I can be <strong><em>more productive</em></strong>, things I could have done better, etc..</p>

<p>So, when <a href='http://jeyakarthika.com/coding-cloning-3-weeks-with-thinkful/index.html' #comment-1309588672">Aatash Patel</a> left a comment asking me to share my experience with ThinkFul, I thought I will take the time write out my reflections as a blog post so that more people can get an idea about the course.</p>

<p>I will not go through the general course structure and how it works because, Javier Collades has already given a very comprehensive review on his blog. You can read it <a href='http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/' >here</a>. This will be more about why I did the course, how it helped me, &amp; the challenges I faced along the way.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="whyichosethinkful">Why I chose ThinkFul?</h2>

<p>I was not a complete beginner nor was I new to programming. So, why did I do it? I have been self-learning for atleast 3 months. I was not even sure if I was absorbing anything I was learning. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I felt like I knew most of the pieces of the puzzle but didnt't know which piece to start with nor how to put them together as a whole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's when I realized I needed someone to guide me a little bit and point out where I go wrong and nudge me in the right direction. </p>

<p>Basically, <strong><em>I needed a mentor and a course to structure my learning.</em></strong> While searching, I coundn't find any dev bootcamps or course providers who are located in brisbane. That's when I found thinkful, and liked the fact that it covered all my requirements. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By choosing ThinkFul, I got a Structured Learning, Weekly Mentor Sessions, Flexible learning options and a  Supportive Community, all with in a small budget.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="whathaveilearnt">What have I learnt?</h2>

<p>On the technical front,</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>AJAX/JSON</li>
<li>Git and</li>
<li>Design Fundamentals</li>
</ul>

<p>But, more importantly, to put the puzzle together from start to finish. I have learnt to,</p>

<ul>
<li>plan the website before coding</li>
<li>make design decisions</li>
<li>create good user experiences</li>
<li>observe object-oriented coding practices</li>
<li>practice commenting the code</li>
<li>identify cross-browser issues</li>
<li>create responsive websites</li>
<li>use devtools to identify and fix issues</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challengesifaced">Challenges I faced</h2>

<h3 id="1time">1. Time</h3>

<p>Working full-time left me only a couple of hours everynight and the weekends for my use. So, I ended up adding a recurring alert to learn web development for atleast 2 hours each day.  </p>

<h3 id="2commitment">2. Commitment</h3>

<p>There were days when I just wanted to relax after a full day's work and not to get back to learning. On those days I relaxed a bit and did some design inspiration browsing and reading latest tech news, blogs, etc..  </p>

<h3 id="3perfection">3. Perfection</h3>

<p>I have a trait which pushes me to do nothing short of perfection. I had to learn that its okay to sometimes just leave the project imperfect and move on to learn the next thing.  </p>

<h3 id="4makingmistakes">4. Making Mistakes</h3>

<p>I was afraid to make mistakes initially. I tend to work on it until I felt there were no bugs at all before posting it to the forum for feedback. But, I have started accepting the fact that it is alright to make mistakes mainly because the community is very supportive and everyone tries to help each other and the mentors do not judge but provide constructive feedbacks, suggestions and pointers to resolve or improve your code.  </p>

<h3 id="5learningnewthings">5. Learning new things</h3>

<p>I love learning new things. But, it is always harder to get started. I managed that by supplementing ThinkFul resources with Tree House, Code school, reading blogs or books or watching videos. I allow myself time for the new concept to sink in. </p>

<p>Discussing with my Mentor, <a href='https://plus.google.com/106018988588816920156/' >Sunil Williams</a> was the best course of action in these cases because he will explain those concepts in simple terms. If I went and read up on the concept after, it will make a lot more sense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="howtomakethebestofit">How to make the best of it?</h2>

<h3 id="1becurious">1. Be Curious</h3>

<p>I guess I have already given you a fair idea of what you could be learning in the course but, as Darrell Silver <a href='https://www.coursereport.com/blog/interview-with-darrell-silver-founder-of-thinkful' >says</a>, Thinkful tries  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to inspire students to expose the curiosity that they have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more curious you are, the more you will be able to get out of this course. </p>

<h3 id="2usethementorsessionswisely">2. Use the mentor sessions wisely.</h3>

<p>You are literally having access to an experienced industry professional who is willing to help you learn. </p>

<p>My mentor, <a href='https://plus.google.com/106018988588816920156/' >Sunil Williams</a> gave me insights into his freelancing life, projects and how he debugs issues with his code, etc.. I was able to observe how he works logically on complex pieces of codes. </p>

<p>My sessions pretty much always went outside the curriculum and we discuss the concepts or the technologies I heard/read about that week and he introduces me to new stuff I could integrate to my code and at the end of the session gives me a summary of our discussions and all the new tools and resources he shared with me. This gives me something to refer back and keep in track of what I need to do and learn that week.</p>

<h3 id="3practice">3. Practice</h3>

<p>For each project try and implement atleast one new piece of technology that you don't understand yet. That way, you will be able to understand and get a complete grasp of that technology by the time you finish the project. And, only when you practice, you will learn more.</p>

<h3 id="4learnthedesignunitinparalel">4. Learn the design unit in paralel</h3>

<p>I would recommend doing the design component in parallel with the other components so that you can use those concepts when you plan for each project. This way when you do your portfolio, you will be familiar with the design process and you can do the best design to showcase all your projects.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="whyshouldyougoforit">Why should you go for it?</h2>

<p>In summary, I would really recommend Thinkful because you get the following,</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Syllabus</li>
  <li>Mentors  </li>
  <li>Community &amp; Office Hours  </li>
  <li>Budget  </li>
  <li>Project-based learning  </li>
  <li>Progressive learning  </li>
  <li>Good for newbies  </li>
  <li>Flexibility</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the type of course where <strong><em>you can only learn as much as you want to. It will be more or less based on the type of commitment and passion you have.</em></strong></p>

<p>So, yeah go for it. You will not regret it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wow! This could be the longest post I have ever written. But, I really wanted to cover the questions that have been put forward to me. I am willing to answer any specific questions you might have regarding my learning journey with ThinkFul.

<p style="text-align: justify;">No, am not talking about the temperature. Though I should add, it is much cooler compared to the last two weeks, thanks to the thunderstorm last week.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and there was this beautiful double rainbow. By the time I recovered from the magic of the rainbow and realized I should have captured that moment, it was gradually receding and I could barely see the second rainbow.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Coming back to the title, Hot or Cold is a Number Guessing Game Project which I have just completed as part of my ThinkFul Front-End Web Development Course.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hot or Cold Game</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">With 2014 (<a title="New Year Resolutions" href='http://freshsqueaks.com/new-year-resolutions/'  target="_blank">Have you read about my new year resolutions yet?</a>), my learning at Thinkful has progressed on from <a title="Coding &amp; Cloning: 3 Weeks with Thinkful" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/coding-cloning-3-weeks-with-thinkful/'  target="_blank">Cloning</a> with HTML5 &amp; CSS3 to Gaming with jQuery &amp; javascript.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am very excited to introduce you to my <span style="color: #99cc00;"><a title="Hot or Cold?" href='http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/hotORcold/'  target="_blank"><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Hot or Cold Game v3.4</strong></span></a></span> (Version 3.4? yep, it underwent 3 iterations starting with just basic functionality, then design and finally improving the functionality based on the design).</p>  

<p><img src='http://jeyakarthika.com/content/images/2014/Mar/hotorcold.jpg'  alt="Hot or Cold ThinkFul Game App" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can look through the code at my Thinkful <a title="Thinkful Project Repository" href='https://github.com/jeyakarthika/ThinkFul/tree/gh-pages'  target="_blank">git repo</a> or play the game at the Hot or Cold <a title="Hot or Cold Game" href='http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/hotORcold/'  target="_blank">project page</a>.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, What do you think? Of course, there is room for a lot of improvement starting with the logic, responsiveness, etc., But am just happy with it for starters and hope to do a lot better in the next project.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Until then, Happy Coding! :)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning everyday feels great, even if it is very little, I like the sense of accomplishment it lends me. That is how I spent the best part of the day, learning Javascript.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">While that was productive, the rest of the day was quite refreshing and relaxed. I can already feel it in my bones that this new year is going to be  totally awesome.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">And, What better way to end the first day of this new year than to list and evaluate my new year resolutions for 2014. Although am not usually a "new-year-resolution" sort of person, I thought I will do it this time for fun and find out what I wanted to accomplish in this new year out of the top of my head in 5 minutes. It goes like this, <!--more--></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">  
<ol>  
    <li>Take Better Care Of Me and Mine.</li>
    <li>Learn something new everyday and Help others learn.</li>
    <li>Embrace Failure. I will not be afraid to make mistakes or accept it.</li>
    <li>Perfect &amp; Streamline a productive workflow.</li>
    <li>Unclutter everything starting from my inbox.</li>
    <li>Complete Front-end Web Development Course with <a title="Coding &amp; Cloning with ThinkFul" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/blog/coding-cloning-3-weeks-with-thinkful/'  target="_blank">ThinkFul</a>.</li>
    <li>Learn Responsive Mobile first design.</li>
    <li>Use Better Programming Practices.</li>
    <li>Design and Code my first WordPress theme.</li>
    <li>Create &amp; Build my portfolio.</li>
    <li>Improve design skills.</li>
    <li>Exercise my left brain with lots of Creative thinking.</li>
    <li>Read atleast one book which is not in the category of novel or technology.</li>
    <li>Indulge in Macro Photography</li>
    <li>Take at least 2 vacations from everything.</li>
</ol>  

<p></ol>  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think this is a pretty impressive list of achievable things to come up in just 5 minutes and I hope to have fun checking them off this year.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking back on 2013 and looking forward to 2014, beyond this list of resolutions, I have figured out what I want out of my life. It is a very simple list of just the following 3 things in increasing order of priority,</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">  
<ol>  
    <li style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Form Productive Habits,</span></strong></em></li>
    <li style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Learn More &amp;</span></strong></em></li>
    <li style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Be happy.</span></strong></em></li>
</ol>  

<p></ol>  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, What do you think? Did you make any resolutions today? Let me know by commenting below or tweet <a title="Jeya Karthika's Twitter" href='http://twitter.com/itsjktweeting'  target="_blank">me</a>.</p>]]></description><link>http://jeyakarthika.com/new-year-resolutions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">9c352b54-9b00-4565-bdc0-fe4890c6e8e2</guid><category><![CDATA[Musings]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeya Karthika]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 23:27:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coding & Cloning: 3 Weeks with Thinkful]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://jeyakarthika.com/content/images/2014/Mar/coding.png'  alt="featureimage" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Amidst the Christmas cheer &amp; Boxing day shopping, I just remembered that its been 3 weeks since I started my Front-End Web Development Course with <a title="ThinkFul" href='http://www.thinkful.com/'  target="_blank">Thinkfu</a>l. And, what better way to spend a hot afternoon than sipping an icy pomintea (Ooh, That is my latest experiment in the kitchen, DM me for a recipie :) ) and reflecting on my journey thus far.<!--more--></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can hear your mind buzzing about my choice of post title. Coding is fine.. But, Cloning? Before you get carried away, definitely not the biotechnological type. This is more of the Thinkful kind, where you apply what you have learnt to recreate well-known websites.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, That is what I have been doing for the past 3 weeks with Thinkful. The experience and progress thus far has been great. To understand what I am talking about, you need to check out this comprehensive <a title="Thinkful FEWD Review" href='http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/'  target="_blank">review</a> by Javier Collado who recently completed the Front-End Web Development Course. So far I have learnt and practiced,</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">  
<ul>  
    <li>Deeper knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3</li>
    <li>Box model and Positioning</li>
    <li>Debugging with Developer tools</li>
    <li>Git and Version Control</li>
    <li>jQuery DOM Traversal &amp; Manipulation</li>
    <li>jQuery Event handling &amp; Interactions</li>
</ul>  

<p></ul>  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But, That is just the beginning and the more awesome part was the mentor sessions and the very supportive Community. The Google plus community is very supportive. When you are stuck, you get immediate answers and feedback on your work from Moderators and Mentors. In addition, Mentors host office hours, which is a video hangout call where you can ask questions and get help.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">My Mentor, Sunil Williams is located in New Zealand. We do a skype chat every week to go through my progress with the course material, the projects, ways I could have done better, etc.. That's not all, he frequently points me to valuable tools and resources that I could use to enhance my workflow, and knowledge.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">You are welcome to checkout my ThinkFul project <a title="ThinkFul Projects Repository" href='https://github.com/jeyakarthika/ThinkFul'  target="_blank">repository</a> or the project <a title="ThinkFul Projects Page" href='http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/'  target="_blank">page</a> at <a title="My GitHub Profile" href='https://github.com/jeyakarthika/'  target="_blank">GitHub</a> and provide useful comments. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am totally looking forward to exploring JavaScript in depth this new year and of course, will keep you posted on my progress. Happy Coding. :)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These photographs account for my month long absence from blogging... So, I was in India for a month spending some quality time with friends and family. I didn't have much time for learning web development stuff  while I was there. But, I managed to do 2 things while I was away.</p>

<ol>  
    <li>Come up with some concept projects to work on after the vacation which I hope will help shape my learning in a positive manner.</li>
    <li>Make a  list of the <a title="Web Design &amp; Development Resources" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/resources/'  target="_blank">resources</a> I have been using for my reference and now available for your use <a title="Resources" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/resources/'  target="_blank">here</a>. Do you think I have missed out an awesome resource that myself and others could benefit from? Email <a title="Email Jeya Karthika" href='mailto:' <a href='mailto:hello@jeyakarthika.com' >hello@jeyakarthika.com</a>">me</a> or tweet <a title="Tweet Jeya Karthika" href='http://twitter.com/itsjktweeting'  target="_blank">me</a> the link and I ‘ll add it here ♥ :)</li>
</ol>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">On my learning front, Am starting a course with <a title="Thinkful" href='http://www.thinkful.com/'  target="_blank">Thinkful</a> from Dec 3rd.. Further updates on that will follow.. Until then, Hope you will enjoy what I saw through my lens in <a title="Jeya KArthika's Flickr Stream" href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeyakarthika/'  target="_blank">flickr</a> :) For those who are interested, I used a Nikon D5100 with a combination of Nikkor 50mm and Tamron 18-270mm.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After exploring "<a title="What is Design? - My Perception" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/what-is-design/'  target="_blank">What is design?</a>", naturally the next stop was to learn about the fundamentals of design. By fundamentals, I mean the <strong><em>Elements and Principles of Design</em></strong>. By all means, this was the most confusing topic I have ever researched upon. Oh, the information available is plentiful. In fact, When I turned to Google for help, it gave me no less than 40, 100, 000 search results. But, the obstacle was to go through them and come up with my own conclusions.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, this is merely my research notes after those long hours spent trying to make sense of what, why and how - about the elements and principles of design. You can find most of the links I found useful in the <a title="Scroll down to References Section" href="#references">Reference</a> section, towards the bottom of this post.<!--more--></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The elements of design are the basic building blocks which are used to create the design.</p>

<h3>Line</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">A line is the continuous movement of a point along a surface. A line is a mark between 2 points. There are various types of lines, from straight to squiggly to curved and more. Lines can be used for a wide range of purposes like stressing a word, connecting content to one another, creating patterns and much more. Line is the element of art that is used to define shape contours and outlines. Line may be a continuous mark or may be implied by the edges of shapes and forms. Line has many different characteristics and may be thick or thin, long or short, and curved or straight.</p>

<h3>Space</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">The distance or area around, between or within components of the design is called space. Space falls into two categories: positive space and negative space. Positive space refers to the area that a shape or form occupies. Negative space is the space around the object. Both negative and positive spaces play an important role in design.</p>

<h3>Texture</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the surface quality or feel and can be tactile or implied. Texture is the surface quality of an object. There are two categories of texture: real texture and implied texture. Real texture refers to how the object would feel if it was touched. Implied texture refers to something that has been made to look as if it has texture through drawing or painting techniques (ie: a drawing of a tree with rough looking bark).</p>

<h3>Shape/Form</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shape/Form gives definition to the objects. Shape is the element of design that occurs when a line intersects itself or another line to enclose a space. Three-dimensional shapes are called forms. Both shape and form can be either geometric or organic.</p>

<h3>Colour/ Value</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is used to draw attention and can invoke mood or emotion. Colour is described with the words hue, value and intensity. Hue refers to the name of the colour, value is the lightness/darkness of the colour and intensity is the amount of saturation in the hue.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">——————————♥——————————</p>

<h2>Principles of Design</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Principles of design are the laws used to create the design using some or all of the relevant elements.</p>

<h3>Unity</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unity is the organization of the elements and principles into a cohesive and pleasing whole design or composition.</p>

<h3>Balance</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Balance is the weighted relationship between the visual elements. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance refers to an item that looks the same on both sides of a line drawn through the center. Asymmetrical balance is when an item creates a feeling of equal weight on both sides even though they do not look the same.</p>

<h3>Rhythm</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Rhythm is the repetition of an element to achieve movement in a composition. It allows the eye to move from one part of a design to another part.</p>

<h3>Proportion</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Proportion refers to the relationship between one part of a design to another. It is a comparison of sizes, shapes and quantities.</p>

<h3>Emphasis</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Emphasis refers to the focus of attention in the composition. It is the quality that draws the viewer's attention to a certain part of the design.</p>

<h3>Similarity and Contrast</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">An effective use of contrast enables you to add interest to your design by highlighting specific graphic elements. This will result in a more visually striking composition. To achieve this 'contrast' is employed as a means of creating a visual hierarchy among different graphic elements. It can be applied to graphic elements, as light, dark, warm, cool, large, small; etc.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrast is most effective when it is strong; the focal point of a design is usually a result of contrast where the eyes will naturally be drawn. Here contrast can be used to direct the focus of a composition. When used as a device to emphasize or highlight design elements it is important to remember that an ineffective use of contrast may result in confusion.</p>

<h3>Proximity</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">The principle of proximity calls for related items to be grouped visually, creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout. Items unrelated to each other should be placed further apart, to emphasize their lack of relationship.</p>

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hierarchy arranges elements to create focal points by positioning their priority within a concept as a whole.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So, What do you think?</h4>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">The elements and principles of design that I have listed here are basically what I have ended up with by comparing numerous sources. This is not an accurate list but it gives you the idea.</p>

(Believe it or not, it has been a mission impossible till date.) So, I got the Mailbox app and spent an entire evening swiping left and right. That's when I noticed this little something buried in the inbox. Nearly a month back, On the request of a friend preparing for CAPM, I prepared a list of tips from my experience to help her get through the exam. Thought it will be a good idea to post it here and help others who are thinking about taking up project management certification..<!--more--></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Certified Associate in Project Manager (CAPM)</strong></em> is awarded by the <em><strong><a title="PMI Website" href='http://www.pmi.org/'  target="_blank">Project Management Institute</a> (PMI)</strong></em>. It recognizes the individual has a fundamental understanding of project management's process and terminology. This credential exemplifies your experience, education, and knowledge; increasing your recognition within an organization and around the world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>  

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to register for the CAPM exam?</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>CAPM Handbook</strong> guides you through the process and also gives you how the questions split-up based on the PMBOK topics. You can view it <a title="CAPM HAndbook - PMI Website" href='http://www.pmi.org/certification/' ~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>  

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">General Exam Tips</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Get the PMBOK. Print out the Knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table. This is very important. Learn it completely.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Learn the inputs, tools &amp; techniques and outputs  for each of the 42 processes. Try to make a chart of that to refer to before the exam.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Download the <a title="CAPM HAndbook Link" href='http://www.pmi.org/certification/' ~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx" target="_blank">CAPM Handbook</a> and learn the PMI Code of Ethics &amp; Professional Conduct from Page 36 to 40. You will have questions from this.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">4. For questions on Code of ethics, If the ethics is violated, report them to the authorities, the value of the crime is never important, talk to the person, get the facts straight and only after that you should report. If your choices have check the rules or confirm with company policies, that is the right answer. If there is a choice of talk to the person, then that should be chosen than reporting.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">5. The level of authority project managers have in different types of organizations.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Write down the formulas as soon as you sit down for the exam.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">7. If you feel that more than one answer is right choose the one which the project manager should do first, where applicable.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">8. Always try to picture which knowledge area and process group the question belongs to before answering. It is advisable to draw a skeleton of the knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table after you write down the formulas. I found this to help me a lot during the exam.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">9. Always answer the question from PMI's perspective. (some PMI'isms are listed below as a reference for you.)</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">10.Watch out for noise/distractors in the questions, ie., unnecessary data which distracts you from the question.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">11. Always read the question first. This will help you to cut through the noise/distractors quickly and arrive at the right answer.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>  

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Formulas</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>12. PV = FV / (1 + i)<sup>n</sup></em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">13. Cost Variance, <em>CV = EV- AC</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">14. Schedule Variance, <em>SV = EV - PV</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">15. Variance at Completion, <em>VAC = BAC - EAC</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">16. Cost Performance Index, <em>CPI = EV / AC</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">17. Schedule Performance Index, <em>SPI = EV / PV</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">18. Estimate to Completion, <em>ETC = EAC - AC</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">19. To-Complete Performance Index, <em>TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)</em> or <em>(BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">20. Communication Channels, with N as no. of stakeholders = <em>N (N-1) / 2</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>21. PERT = (O + 4M +P) / 6</em> where O is Optimistic, P is Pessimistic &amp; M is Most-Likely</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">22. Expected Monetary Value, <em>EMV = % of risk occuring  x risk impact</em></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>23. Float = LS - ES</em> or <em>LF - EF</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>  

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">PMI'isms</h2>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">24.Projects should be strategically aligned with the high-level strategic objectives of the organization.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">25. Engaging the stakeholders early is important and they are involved throughout the project.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">26. Planning is the most important of all the Project Management processes.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">27. The Project Team must be involved early in the Planning process and in all major decisions concerning the project.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">28. Sponsor provides the funds.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">29. Customer uses the product.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">30. If it is a problem, always do something to move closer to the solution.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">31. Face to Face is the best way to communicate.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">32. To manage conflicts, Confronting and Collaborating are the best techniques.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">33. While resolving conflicts or solving problems, it should involve the people with the problem.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">34. Project managers should put the best interest of the project before his/her own interests.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">35. Project managers never take shortcuts or skip process steps.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">36. Requirements is not provided by the Project manager.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">37. If someone asks for a change, then the project manager should follow the complete change control process involving the paperworks, approvals and tracking.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">38. Unless approved, Change requests cannot be executed.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">39. Rewards and Recognition helps to improve productivity.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">40. The project manager is assigned during project initiating, not later in the life of the project.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">41. Adding out-of-scope extras (also called “gold plating”) to please project stakeholders is strongly discouraged.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">42. No project is complete unless there has been final acceptance from the customer.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, There you go. I have listed everything I remember in no particular order. All the best. :)</p>]]></description><link>http://jeyakarthika.com/capm-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">14fbfb5c-5ecf-4b6e-bee3-bbbf5ba7ac9a</guid><category><![CDATA[PMI'isms]]></category><category><![CDATA[Project Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[CAPM]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeya Karthika]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 12:04:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ryu, Project Management, Html & CSS]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I had basically disappeared off the face of blogging for the couple of months. What was I upto? After all those talk about focused learning, I got to work right away! Yep, My first step was knowing myself better atleast my learning pattern. What I needed was the right combination of books (yes! the ones you hold in your hands and flip the pages.. No, I am not talking about flipboard.) to complement my learning through online resources.<!--more--></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">In between, I was preparing for my PMI Certificate in Associate Project Management. And, Guess what? I got it :) I am now <em><strong>PMI Certified in Associate Project Management</strong></em>. The learning part was not a piece of cake but not super hard either. I will soon share <a title="Getting prepared for CAPM: Tips, Formulas &amp; PMI’isms" href='http://jeyakarthika.com/capm-preparation/'  target="_blank">tips and pointers from my experience on the entire exam process</a>, but that is for another time.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">As I was saying, I set out to find proper books to complement my learning which will somehow help me wrap my head around all the concepts that I had learnt thus far in a structured manner.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">My Primary focus was HTML &amp; CSS. Thus I decided on 4 books to make me atleast half-decent &amp; confident on these topics. So, Here we go, I am using the following books,</p>  

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">1. <span style="color: #99cc00;"><a title="HTML &amp; CSS: design and build websites" href='http://htmlandcssbook.com/'  target="_blank"><span style="color: #99cc00;">HTML &amp; CSS: design and build websites</span></a> </span>by <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Jon Duckett</span></p>  

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">2. <span style="color: #99cc00;"><a title="HTML5 for Web Designers" href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers'  target="_blank"><span style="color: #99cc00;">HTML5 for Web Designers</span></a></span> by <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Jeremy Keith</span></p>  

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">3. <span style="color: #99cc00;"><a title="CSS3 for Web Designers" href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers'  target="_blank"><span style="color: #99cc00;">CSS3 for Web Designers</span></a></span> by <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Dan Cederholm</span></p>  

<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">4. <span style="color: #99cc00;"><a title="Responsive Web Design" href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design'  target="_blank"><span style="color: #99cc00;">Responsive Web Design</span></a></span> by <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Ethan Marcotte</span></p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and am nearly done with Jon Duckett's book. It is simply awesome. I am loving every page of it. Of course, I will follow up with a much deserved review on the book soon.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I sign off, one last thing which you might have noticed already. I have redesigned the blog with a clutterless, minimal theme from <a title="Automattic Wordpress Profile" href='http://profiles.wordpress.org/automattic/'  target="_blank"><em><strong>Automattic</strong></em></a> called <a title="Ryu Wordpress Theme" href='http://wordpress.org/themes/ryu'  target="_blank"><em><strong>Ryu</strong></em></a>. It was not without regrets that I chose to move away from the theme <a title="Shift Theme Demo" href='http://demo.codestag.com/?theme=shift'  target="_blank"><em><strong>Shift</strong></em></a> by<strong> </strong><a title="CodeStag" href='http://codestag.com/'  target="_blank"><em><strong>CodeStag</strong></em></a>, which I was using before. I love colours and Shift was everything I would love in a theme - colourful, functional and feature-rich. But, I wanted a change and so, here it is.  I love the typography based design which makes every post just pop at you. So, How do you like the new look? Leave your comments below. :)</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>]]></description><link>http://jeyakarthika.com/ryu/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c96fb49b-0a14-458e-8ee8-61af7655f298</guid><category><![CDATA[Musings]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeya Karthika]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2013 16:40:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Focused Learning is What Matters]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Web design and development is a vast field which evolves very quickly. For someone like me to make this the career path, I would suggest to stay focused. I know html5, css3, jQuery and javascript. I know photoshop, illustrator and indesign.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">I know everything but feels like nothing because during the process of learning it is quite easy to lose focus. It is easy to keep on learning but the most difficult part is knowing the difference between what you know and what you think you know. <!--more-->I started with html5 but before completely knowing everything I moved in to css3, then <!--more-->javascript and before completing that jQuery. This just makes me the Jack of all trades and king of none.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, I have made a decision to stick to one at a time and keep to it until am completely confident with it. I have realized that focused learning is what matters the most.</p>]]></description><link>http://jeyakarthika.com/focused-learning-is-what-matters/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3b4efc87-e842-4fd4-a73f-2810e3ec642b</guid><category><![CDATA[Musings]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeya Karthika]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2013 11:34:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
